# Tech Stack

## Programming Language
The primary programming language for the application will be **JavaScript/TypeScript**. This choice leverages a robust and widely-adopted ecosystem, providing strong typing benefits for enhanced code quality and maintainability, which is ideal for modern web application development.

## Front-End Framework
The user interface will be built using **React**. As a leading JavaScript library for building interactive and dynamic user interfaces, React is well-suited for creating a responsive and engaging reading tracker application.

## Build Tool and Package Manager
For development and dependency management, the project will utilize **Bun**. Bun serves as an all-in-one JavaScript runtime, bundler, test runner, and package manager, chosen for its exceptional speed and efficiency to optimize the development workflow.

## UI Component Library/Styling Framework
The application will implement a **Kokonut UI (Custom/Conceptual)**. This approach signifies the development of a tailored UI component library or the extensive customization of existing components to strictly adhere to the project's defined "Elegant & Minimalist" aesthetic and "Clean Lines & Subtle Gradients" visual principles.

## Data Storage
For local data persistence, the primary mechanism will be **localStorage (with JSON serialization)**. This aligns with the requirement to save progress locally in a single-file format, leveraging the browser's native `localStorage` capabilities and JSON for efficient serialization and deserialization of structured book data and checklist information.
